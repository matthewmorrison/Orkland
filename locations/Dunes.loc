{"name":"Dunes","x":"11.351","y":"-122.607","description":"The Dunes are vast stretches of billowing sand dunes -- thus the clever name -- on the southwest end of the eastern point of Bergis Bay. The Glamis of Orkland, the shifting sands are constantly in mild motion as the breezes from the Palantir Ocean rearrange the fine grains of sand into larger and smaller piles. Dotted with stray cacti and lonesome rocks, only vultures, hardy beetles, sidewinders and the like can eke out an existence on the sun-blasted sands. It is said that among the rarely exposed skeletons of giant creatures and foolhardy adventurers there are forgotten tombs from a nameless civilization.","tags":"Desert, Sand"}
