{"name":"Run's House","x":"11.609","y":"-166.641","description":"A sprawling Southern gentleOrk's plantation, Reverend Run is known for shrewd business dealings and lavish parties. The beautifully kept grounds surrounding the three-story antebellum house are meticulously gardened by a swarm of Goblins under the watchful eye and lash of Run's Grand Master of Flowers -- a wizened Oriental human in nondescript tan robes. Trimmed hedges run for almost half a mile from the walls of Gnash's Keep along the road to the west, separating the filthy bustle of Gronk street life from the gardens and reflecting ponds within. \n\nDear to the Reverend's heart is the spacious acres of trimmed grass, sifted sand pits, and bucket-fed water features to the southwest of the plantation proper, where he has been obsessed with a rich person's game called \"Gorf\" where a curved stick is used to whack a ball into tiny holes across hundreds of yards of Goblin-scissored grass.\n \nDue to the constant upkeep, Rev Run is far and away the largest employer in Gronk, owning most every shack in the maze like Goblin slums and getting his pay back immediately when the rent is due. With a tight arrangement with Gnash the Stone Giant, many high-ranking military officers, celebrities, and other personalities stay in the many suites at Run's House rather than the more austere environs of the Keep. In return, the below-boards dealings of Run and his network of minions have little to fear from the law in Gronk. Each successful business pays their fair share of insurance to Run in return for their business licensing. \n","tags":"House, Plantation, Gorf, Garden"}
