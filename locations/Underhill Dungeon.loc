{"name":"Underhill Dungeon","x":"17.476","y":"-176.858","description":"Extraordinarily difficult to find, Underhill is the last known location of a legendary trio of artifacts -- the Bell, the Book, and the Candle. Lost for decades, these items supposedly have the ability to open a portal to a different dimension. Recent rumor has speculated that the artifacts have been found and removed from the dungeon. The local tribes of Troglodytes have been exceedingly restless, threatening trade along the old road west of the Lighthouse and encroaching into the south of the Toothpick Forest far enough to piss off the Bleeding Eye tribe. Riding their somewhat domesticated Giant Ant steeds, the forays of the Troggs seem to grow ever wider in search of their new King.","tags":"Dungeon, Artifact, Troglodyte"}
