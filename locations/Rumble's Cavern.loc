{"name":"Rumble's Cavern","x":"29.707","y":"-161.653","description":"Rumble's legendary tavern was built around a gigantic oak tree that marked where the Grizzle and Madonna roads intersected. After adventuring until 3rd level, Rumble, the vegetarian half-Ogre retired until he sat under the Orkland instance of Shel Silverstein's \"The Giving Tree\". Years later, the ramshackle building with the mighty oak growing out of the roof has become an Orkland landmark. \n\nThe homely exterior belies the perceived size once inside. Whispered to be one of the original World Serpent Inns that bend spacetime and occasionally provide portals to other realms and planes, most everyone is welcomed to the smoky environment by Rumble the Half-Ogre himself, wearing his \"Kiss the 'Tender\" apron from behind the wide and wandering live oak bar.","tags":"Lodging, Spirits, Inn, Portal, Food"}
