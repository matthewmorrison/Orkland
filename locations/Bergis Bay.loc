{"name":"Bergis Bay","x":"13.667","y":"-133.154","description":"Bergis Bay is the sea-end of the slow-moving Gumpus river. Brown with alluvial deposits and much feces-based fertilizer moving downstream from the Goblin farming efforts near Walpurgis and Paddywak, the shallow water is teeming with aquatic life. Many sea birds and other hunting animals enjoy the quieter parts of the bay, especially on the northern side of the isle created by Bergis Peak which provides a sea break to in the mouth of the inlet. \n\nOccasionally, very low tides will expose stretches of the seabed, where numerous tidal sandbars and great coral reefs lay, some dotted with the wrecks of old schooners and strange columns and bas-reliefs from forgotten civilizations.","tags":"Water, Ocean, Bay, Reef"}
