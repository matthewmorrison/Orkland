{"name":"Gronk","x":"12.855","y":"-165.498","description":"One of the larger and more martial southern outposts in Orkland, the skyline of Gronk is dominated by Gnash the Stone Giant's Keep. Heavily populated with Ork soldiers and support teams, Gronk is known as a R-and-R post for weary battalions from the War in the North. Many of the businesses in Gronk specifically cater to the military, and this is supported and encouraged by Reverend Run of Run's House. Gronk has been established for many years, but the edges of the town have been spilling into the southern Jumpback Grasslands for years, where the lightly rolling hills and open space make for easy expansion, as long as the trash piles of the Goblin slums are kept burning.","tags":"Town, Food, Lodging, Spirits, Weapons, Armor, Church"}
