{"name":"Gnatspit","x":"30.240","y":"-162.620","description":"Anchored by Rumble's Cavern, Gnatspit was originally just the meeting of the north-south Madonna Road and the Grizzle Road to the west where a couple of trader tents popped up under a lone oak tree to serve the caravans traveling from Gronk to the north. Now a sleepy Southern town, Gnatspit is home to a number of Goblin farmers and ranchers, as well as a bustling general store. The inherent racism of Orkland is much milder here, typical of the gentrified South of the continent, and the town square is a thriving swap meet most every day of the week.
